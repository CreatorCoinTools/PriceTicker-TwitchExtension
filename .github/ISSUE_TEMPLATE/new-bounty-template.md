=========================
**Bounty: Bounty Name**
Status: üü° PENDING üü°
**Reward:  <Bounty Admin's will decide>**
=========================

**Description:** Give a high level introduction to the bounty. Make sure to include a purpose, goal, and rough idea of what it is.

**Use Cases:** Include a few examples of using the bounty deliverable, or flows that represent end user interactions with the deliverable. This helps the bounty hunter know what they are trying to do, and who they are trying to do it for.  


**Minimum Requirements:**
- A bullet list to describe the things that are must haves. 
- This should be a list of deliverables and should include any expectations on delivery or ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù of those deliverables
- The community will be weighing the execution of this list, so it is important to outline correctly in order to make grading easier.


:notebook: Note: Add an optional qualification or bit of info for a bounty hunter.
